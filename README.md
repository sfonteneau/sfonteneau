## 🔧 About me

- 🛠️ I mainly work on the **WAPT project** and various **Samba4 projects** at Tranquilit ([doc.wapt.fr](https://doc.wapt.fr)).  
- Many of the projects on this GitHub are primarily sponsored by **Tranquilit**. Advanced support for certain projects is available through Tranquilit’s paid services.  
- 🧪 I enjoy publishing small **open-source Python tools** mainly for sysadmins to make their life easier.  
- 🎸 When I’m not coding: guitar and home automation projects.
